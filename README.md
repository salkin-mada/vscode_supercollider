SuperCollider syntax grammars for VSCode

the language-supercollider extension is an enhanced flavor of [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) syntax highlighting for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

converted from the supercollider-source with some additions

install from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) or clone/place this repo in ~\.vscode\extensions\

[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) is a programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

The language (sclang) communicates via Open Sound Control with one or more synthesis servers. The SuperCollider synthesis server runs in a separate process or even on a separate machine so it is ideal for realtime networked music.

Does not include any REPL (language shell) or interaction with sclang. This is just for editing SuperCollider code.


This extension is tested on Linux and Windows.
